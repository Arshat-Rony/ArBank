## Project Description

   Arbank is a professional bank website where user can visit and take the facility of a professional. He could take loans pay for the loans.IF anyone enter as an admin he can check the total balance of the bank also total loan and total user of that bank. If he want then he can remove any user prominently.

    Project front-end part is grabbed with reactjs and many of react library since reactjs is a flexible library of javascript with jsx and with this we can make dynamic components which we can change later.

    Project Back-end part is grabbed with Nodejs. Since I used Javascript in my fornt-end so I took the same flavour in te backend also.
